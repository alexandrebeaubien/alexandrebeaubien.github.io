I am a Ph.D. candidate in High Energy Particle Physics at the <a href='https://www.uvic.ca/'>University of Victoria</a> working in collaboration with the <a href='https://www.belle2.org/'>Belle II Experiment</a>, a electron-positron collider located at the SuperKEKB collider in Tsukuba, Japan.

My research touches multiple aspects of the research environment at <a href='https://www.belle2.org/'>Belle II</a>.
I develop inovative software tools used in the analysis of our dataset including machine learning driven particle identification tools and an adversarially trained CNN-GAN used to simulate background waveforms in our electromagnetic calorimeter.
I am also leading the measurement of the $e^+e^- -> \pi^+\pi^-$ cross section at the full SuperKEKB beam energy.
I have recently participated in the development of a transversely polarized electron source for the proposed Chiral Belle upgrade to the SuperKEKB collider.
